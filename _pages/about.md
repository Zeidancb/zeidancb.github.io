Iâ€™m Canon Bassam Zeidan, a PhD student in Biophysics at the University of Pittsburgh. My academic background is rooted in stochastic methods, computational modeling, and statistical mechanics, which I now apply to questions in theoretical ecology. My primary research interests lie at the intersection of community ecology and complex systems, where I focus on the mechanisms that drive species coexistence and the emergent behavior of ecosystems across multiple scales. Through multi-scale modeling, I aim to better understand how local interactions shape large-scale ecological patterns and dynamics.
